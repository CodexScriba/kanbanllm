# Architecture & Design Context

This file provides high-level architecture and design context for your project. Edit this file to add project-specific information that will help LLMs understand your codebase structure and design decisions.

## System Architecture

[Describe your system architecture here]

Example:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Deployment: AWS with Docker containers

## Key Design Decisions

[Document important design decisions here]

Example:
1. **State Management**: Using Redux for global state
2. **API Design**: RESTful API with JWT authentication
3. **Testing Strategy**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E

## Project Structure

[Explain your project folder structure]

Example:
```
src/
├── components/  # React components
├── services/    # API services
├── utils/       # Utility functions
└── types/       # TypeScript types
```

## Coding Standards

[Document coding standards and conventions]

Example:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage
- Use meaningful variable names

## Dependencies

[List key dependencies and why they were chosen]

Example:
- axios: HTTP client with interceptor support
- zod: Runtime type validation
- date-fns: Date manipulation library

## Notes

This context is automatically injected when you copy tasks with the "Copy with Context" feature, helping LLMs understand your project structure and make better suggestions.
